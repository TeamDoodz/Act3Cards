# Act3Cards
Use cards from act 3 (or any act for that matter) in act 1

## How to use
Just download the mod and it should work normally. Keep in mind that there may be bugs. <br/> <br/>
The Skeleton and Empty Vessel cards are not present in choice nodes. If you have the side deck selector mod installed, those cards will be possible choices for side decks.

## Config
Right now you can: 
- Enable/disable different temples
- Choose whether or not cards with no high-res portrait will be present.
- Give Empty Vessels the "Null Conduit" sigil.
- Choose whether or not act 2 spells are taken into account.

## Known issues
- Beastly cards from Act 2 not present
- Some cards will have incorrect or no portraits

## 0.3.0
