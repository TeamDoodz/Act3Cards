# Act3Cards
Use cards from act 3 (or any act for that matter) in act 1

## How to use
Just download the mod and it should work normally. Keep in mind that there may be bugs. <br/> <br/>
The Skeleton and Empty Vessel cards are not present in choice nodes. If you have the side deck selector mod installed, those cards will be possible choices for side decks.

## Config
Right now you can: 
- Enable/disable different temples
- Choose whether or not cards with no high-res portrait will be present.
- Give Empty Vessels the "Null Conduit" sigil.
- Choose whether or not act 2 spells are taken into account.

## Known issues
- Some cards will have incorrect or no portraits

## Changelog

## 1.0.1
- Updated to AraCardExpansionAct2 v1.3.0
- Improved the Mox side deck; instead of giving you random cards, the deck contents are decided at the start of the battle in order to have an equal chance at each mox type.

## 1.0.0
- Mod now has a Github page: https://github.com/TeamDoodz/Act3Cards
- Added a Mox sidedeck. This change won't do anything if you are not using the selectable side deck mod.
- Wizard cards with a high-res portrait now render correctly
- Cards will get procedural tribes based on their name. For example, the Shutterbug will get the Insect tribe because it has "bug" in it's name.
- Made log entries more readable
- Fixed custom textures, I think
- Fixed issue with some gem cards not counting as gems
- Special abilities now work properly, which means spells should work now
- All temples are now on by default
- Mod now requires the Spell Card Toolkit
- Mod now requires TDLib

## 0.3.0
- Updated to AraCardExpansionAct2 v1.0.0
- Unsacrificable cards will now get the terrain card background
- (EXPERIMENTAL) You can now specify custom textures for cards. To do so, create a 114x94 texture with the card's name as the file name and place it in the assets folder. For example, if I wanted to create a custom texture for the Steambot card I would create a 114x94 image and save it as "Steambot.png" in the assets folder.
- Special stat icons now work properly
- Made code more organized

### 0.2.0

- Mod is now compatible with AraCardExpansionAct2
